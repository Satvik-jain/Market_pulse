### APIs
- Alpha Vantage API for stock market data

## üìä API Integration

Market Pulse intelligently integrates multiple financial data sources:

1. **Alpha Vantage API**: Provides historical and intraday stock price data, including OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) values and trading volume.

2. **NewsAPI**: Delivers relevant news articles about selected companies, which are then processed for sentiment analysis.

3. **Finnhub API**: Supplies social sentiment metrics, including bullish percentage and sector comparisons.

Our application implements a smart caching system that optimizes API usage while ensuring data freshness. If any API fails or rate limits are reached, the system seamlessly falls back to realistic mock data to ensure uninterrupted user experience.
